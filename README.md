**Usage**

Once the plugin is installed and configured you will find a new email icon next to each published article in the Pencil Blue admin UI when viewing Content->Articles. Clicking the email icon will result in a prompt to create a new Sendy email campaign from the selected article.

**Templates**

The plugin comes with a basic email template. Override the file `templates/sendy/email.html` in your site's theme to control the layout of the campaign emails generated by this plugin. In addition to the values made available by the base PencilBlue template service, such as `site_name` the following values are made available within the email template:
- `headline` - The article headline
- `content` - The HTML content of the article

**Limitations**

- Currently only works with PencilBlue version 0.5.0
- Will not work well alongside any other plugin that overrides the `manage_articles.html` template.
- Does not work with the default PencilBlue site theme since it is not possible to override `manage_articles.html` when the default theme is the active theme.
